# This is an example file for an animation script
# 
# Text after an octothorp (# symbol) are comments.  
# Comments are not seen by the interpreter 
#
# Some syntax I'd like to offer:
#
# 1. Each property is one word (camelCase recommended) with the value written after separated by a ':'
# 2. whitespace is ignored except for newlines (spaces and tabs dont matter, but new lines do)
# 3. All methods of indexing start at 0 NOT 1 (e.g. array[0] = first element, array[1] = second, etc.)
# 4. Data types can be:
#   i. strings (words) surrounded by quotes

Name: "Walk sequence"
File: "bin/walkSequence.png"

#   ii. ints (integers) as regular numbers

FPS: 12
FrameCount: 48
FrameHeight: 128
FrameWidth: 128

#   iii. floats (decimal numbers) as regular numbers but ending with an f

SomeProperty: 5.693 #idk what you'd need decimal numbers for though

#   iv.booleans (true/false values) written explicitly

Looping: true

#   v. tuples (container of two or more values) inside parethesis with values separated by commas

FrameDimension: (128, 128)    # (height, width)

#   vi. Arrays (orderd lists of values) inside square brackets separated by commas

FrameLocations: [(0,0),(1,0),(2,0)...(47,0)] # (x,y) coordinates of the tiles in the texture

Chiral: True #are the left and right animations included?



# possibly add animation types for help with compiler?  Or maybe do that in sprite scripts?
# add different methods of compiling an animation from texture using keywords
# some options would be things like
# Method: "row" to just load a whole row of tiles, then have properties for things like which row
# some other possible methods:
# "explicit" meaning you have to exactly write out which frames are where (useful for small tile sheets)
# "column" same as row, but with a column instead
